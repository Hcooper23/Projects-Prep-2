## Prepare for Projects
For this project, you will be summarizing all of the concepts you’ve learned and applied in labs up to this point of the course. Your instructional team will provide you with further specification regarding constraints and expectations for course-specific requirements.

At this point, you should have an idea as to what’s possible to create given what your course has covered so far and will cover before the start of the project. Use that knowledge to generate some ideas and discussion!

## Project Requirements
Your instructor will provide the detailed requirements for your project, and team tasks.

## Group Project: Pitch Ideas
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. You’ve been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

## Tasks
As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place. Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this: brainstorm ideas, and pitching projects.

**Brainstorming Ideas**

Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

**Pitching a Project**

Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.

## Create your Pitch
Once your team had decided on 1 or 2 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

Each pitch should contain the following information:

**Name of Project** (Clue)

- Summary of idea.

We will be developing a clue based murder mystery game that has rooms with different hints and will allow the user to choose the room and then allow for them to learn who, what weapon, and how the individual was murdered. With each room will come a background story and a weapons that will be specific to the room. 

- What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)

The animation of the clue cards and how to utilize them and at what stage they would be available to view. The implementation of running either a single js file or multiple for each room to function off of. Keeping each room specific to the story and allow for maximum progress of the idea. 

- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
    - What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
    Have a minimum of 2 rooms to allow for multiple users to be able to have an interactive experience and get a new story from them. With four clue cards and a backstory to each room. 


**Name of Project** (Trivia)

- Summary of idea.
The game will be a challenge trivia game with a score system at the end, that has around 20 question and this will allow for the user to choose a category and have questions based on that category. The game will then result the answer in a chart based on results and how well they did. 

- What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
Just allows for proper education in different categories, that will allow for a user to educate themselves into different categories. It will allow for a user to get new questions they may not have answers to and if they have positive results they will be able to improve knowledge. 

- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
    - What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
    Have at least 20 questions to answer and a chart that has data results. 

## Submitting your work
Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit, please include all names of group members in your pitch document.

As a group, agree on 2 top ideas. In a doc, or in the text area submit your top two pitches. The instructional staff will then approve one of your two ideas. Please have your top choice listed first, and second choice listed last.
